        <p>
            This package implements StAX-specific transformation APIs. It provides
            classes which allow input from a StAX reader, that is, 
            {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader} or {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLEventReader}, 
            and output to a StAX writer, that is, 
            {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter} or {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLEventWriter}.
        </p>
        <p>
            The {@link javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource} class encapsulates a 
            {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader} or {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLEventReader} 
            and can be used as an input where a {@link javax.xml.transform.Source}
            object is accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The {@link javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXResult} class encapsulates a 
            {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter} or {@link javax.xml.stream.XMLEventWriter} 
            and can be used as an output where a {@link javax.xml.transform.Result}
            object is accepted.
        </p>
