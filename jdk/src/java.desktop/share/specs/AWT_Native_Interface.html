<h2>The Java AWT Native Interface Specification and Guide</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Java AWT Native Interface (JAWT) comprises a small set of native
(eg C language-based) APIs that provide a standard supported way
for interaction between Java API windows and surfaces, and
platform native API windows and surfaces.
Non-Java libraries may then render to a Java owned window.
<p>
Note: in this document the terms "Java AWT Native Interface",
"AWT Native Interface" and "JAWT" are interchangeable and
refer to this same specification.
<p>
The fundamental obstacle to native rendering without JAWT is that
is that the rendering code cannot identify where to draw.
The native code needs access to information about a Java
drawing surface (such as a handle to the underlying native ID of a
<tt>Canvas</tt>), but cannot get it.</p>
Without that information (ie without JAWT) an application could
use native rendering only by creating its own top-level window
not shared at all with Java. This is unacceptable for most uses.
Except for usage via JAWT, this is considered to be entirely
internal to the Java platform implementation: private, unsupported
and undocumented.
<p>
JAWT should be supported in all headful implementations
where technically possible although this is not enforced by the JCK.
There is a platform-specific and a platform
independent portion to the API, to account for the differing
data structures and requirements of each platform.
This document specifies the platform independent portions and
also documents the platform dependent portions for the Oracle JDK
supported desktop operating environments.
For AWT the term platform is less tied to the underlying operating
system than it is to the desktop windowing environment.
<p>
Reasons for using the AWT Native Interface include
<ul>
<li>Use of a 3rd party native library not available in Java
<li>A temporary porting aid before converting legacy code to Java
<li>Rendering performance available only to native hardware accelerated APIs
<li>Interoperation with another toolkit
</ul>
<p>
Drawbacks include
<ul>
<li>A more complex application implementation, eg for painting
<li>Potential for application instability if the native library does
not interoperate properly with AWT.
<li>Increased application delivery complexity - per platform binaries
</ul>
The header file <a href="#jawt.h"> "jawt.h"</a>
in the Appendix fully specifies the APIs provided by JAWT.
<p>
An example illustrating how easy it is to use the AWT Native Interface
is presented and discussed later in this document.</p>

<p><b>JAWT usage depends on JNI</b></p>
<p>The definition of Java Standard Edition includes JNI, the Java
Native Interface. Many Java developers will never need to use it,
but the interface is the only standard supported way for a Java
language program to interact directly with
application code that has been compiled to the native machine
instructions for the host processor architecture.
JNI is used where ever there is a need for mixed languages.
These are by no means limited to cases like AWT. For example, you
could use JNI to integrate with native code that communicates with
a peripheral device, such as a scanner, connected to a system via a
USB port.</p>
<p>So JNI is general enough to be used to access almost any
sort of native library.
The rest of this document assumes a familiarity with how
to use JNI.

<p><b>How to use JAWT </b></p>
<p>In this section we describe the most common usage of the AWT
Native Interface &mdash; overriding the <tt>paint</tt> method to
direct drawing operations to a native rendering library which then
queries the Java VM to determine the information it needs in order
to render. Note, however, that any native code may use the AWT
Native Interface to learn about a target drawing surface, not just
code in a <tt>paint</tt> method.</p>
<p>The first step in hooking up a native rendering library to a
Java <tt>Canvas</tt> is to define a new class that extends
<tt>Canvas</tt> and overrides the <tt>paint</tt> method. The Java
system routes all drawing operations for a <tt>Canvas</tt> object
through the <tt>paint</tt> method, as it does for all other GUI
objects. Canvas is a good candidate for the rendering surface as
it does not have any content as a Button would.</p>
<p>The new <tt>paint</tt> method, to be implemented in the native
rendering library, must be declared as <tt>public native void</tt>
, and the native library itself is loaded at runtime by including a
call to <tt>System.loadLibrary( &quot;myRenderingLib&quot;)</tt>in
the <tt>static</tt> block of the class. The <tt>myRenderingLib</tt>
name is used for the native shared library; for Linux or the Solaris
operating environment, the actual name for the library file on disk
is <tt>libmyRenderingLib.so</tt> .</p>
<p>Here is a simple example of such a class:</p>
<pre>
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class MyCanvas extends Canvas {
    static {
        System.loadLibrary("myRenderingLib");
    }
    public native void paint(Graphics g);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Frame f = new Frame();
        f.setBounds(0, 0, 500, 110);
        f.add(new MyCanvas());
        f.addWindowListener( new WindowAdapter() {
            public void windowClosing(WindowEvent ev) {
                System.exit(0);
            }
        } );
        f.show();
    }
}
<br />
</pre>
<p>Note that this class has a <tt>main</tt> method that can be used
to run this code as an application for testing purposes.</p>
<p>The next step is to run the <tt>javah</tt> tool on the
<tt>MyCanvas</tt> class file above to generate a C/C++ header file
that describes the interface to the native <tt>paint</tt> method
that Java expects to be used. <tt>javah</tt> is a standard tool
included with the JDK. NB: <tt>javac -h outputdir</tt> may also be used.</p>

<p>The final step &#173; and the most interesting one &#173; is to
write the native rendering method, with an interface that conforms
to the header file that <tt>javah</tt> generated, and build it as a
standard shared library (called <tt>myRenderingLib</tt> in the
above example) by linking it, against the appropriate JDK provided
$JDK_HOME/lib/$JAWT_LIB library for the target platform.
Where JAWT_LIB has the base name "jawt" and follows platform
shared object naming rules. i.e.:
<ul>
<li>Windows: jawt.dll
<li>MacOS: libjawt.dylib
<li>Linux: libjawt.so
<li>Solaris: libjawt.so
</ul>

This code will call back to the Java virtual machine to
get the drawing surface information it needs to access the
<tt>MyCanvas</tt> peer. Once this information is available, the
code can draw directly to <tt>MyCanvas</tt> using standard drawing
routines supplied by the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>Here is sample source code for a native <tt>paint</tt> method
designed for use in a X11-based drawing environment (Linux
or Solaris) and a Java VM where the AWT Native Interface is present:</p>
<pre>
#include "MyCanvas.h"
#include "jawt_md.h"

/*
 * Class:     MyCanvas
 * Method:    paint
 * Signature: (Ljava/awt/Graphics;)V
 */
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_MyCanvas_paint

{
    JAWT awt;

    JAWT_X11DrawingSurfaceInfo* dsi_x11;
    jboolean result;
    jint lock;
    GC gc;

    short       i;
    char        *testString = "^^^ rendered from native code ^^^";

    /* Get the AWT */
    awt.version = JAWT_VERSION_9;
    if (JAWT_GetAWT(env, &amp;awt) == JNI_FALSE) {
        printf("AWT Not found\n");
        return;
    }

    /* Get the drawing surface */
    ds = awt.GetDrawingSurface(env, canvas);
    if (ds == NULL) {
        printf("NULL drawing surface\n");
        return;
    }

    /* Lock the drawing surface */
    lock = ds-&gt;Lock(ds);
    if((lock &amp; JAWT_LOCK_ERROR) != 0) {

        printf("Error getting surface info\n");
        ds-&gt;Unlock(ds);
        awt.FreeDrawingSurface(ds);
        return;
    }

    /* Get the platform-specific drawing info */
    dsi_x11 = (JAWT_X11DrawingSurfaceInfo*)dsi-&gt;platformInfo;


    /* Now paint */
    gc = XCreateGC(dsi_x11-&gt;display, dsi_x11-&gt;drawable, 0, 0);
    XSetBackground(dsi_x11-&gt;display, gc, 0);
    for (i=0; i&lt;36;i++)
    {
        XSetForeground(dsi_x11-&gt;display, gc, 10*i);
        XFillRectangle(dsi_x11-&gt;display, dsi_x11-&gt;drawable, gc,
                        10*i, 5, 90, 90);
    }
    XSetForeground(dsi_x11-&gt;display, gc, 155);
    XDrawImageString(dsi_x11-&gt;display, dsi_x11-&gt;drawable, gc,
                        100, 110, testString, strlen(testString));
    XFreeGC(dsi_x11-&gt;display, gc);


    /* Free the drawing surface info */
    ds-&gt;FreeDrawingSurfaceInfo(dsi);

    /* Unlock the drawing surface */
    ds-&gt;Unlock(ds);

    /* Free the drawing surface */
    awt.FreeDrawingSurface(ds);
}
</pre>
<p>The key data structure here is <tt>JAWT</tt> , which is defined
in <tt>jawt.h</tt> (included by <tt>jawt_md.h)</tt> ; it provides
access to all the information the native code needs to get the job
done. The first part of the native method is boilerplate: it
populates the <tt>JAWT</tt> structure, gets a
<tt>JAWT_DrawingSurface</tt> structure, locks the surface (only one
drawing engine at a time, please!), then gets a
<tt>JAWT_DrawingSurfaceInfo</tt> structure that contains a pointer
(in the <tt>platformInfo</tt> field) to the necessary
platform-specific drawing information. It also includes the
bounding rectangle of the drawing surface and the current clipping
region.</p>
<p>The structure of the information pointed to by
<tt>platformInfo</tt> is defined in a machine-dependent header file
called <tt>jawt_md.h</tt>. For X11 drawing, it includes
information about the X11 display and X11 drawable associated with
<tt>MyCanvas</tt>. After the drawing operations are completed,
there is more boilerplate code as <tt>JAWT_DrawingSurfaceInfo</tt>
is freed and <tt>JAWT_DrawingSurface</tt> is unlocked and
freed.</p>
<p>The corresponding code for the GDI API on the Microsoft Windows platform would
be structured similarly, but would include the version of
<tt>jawt_md.h</tt> for Microsoft Windows and the structure located
in the <tt>platformInfo</tt> field of drawing surface info would be
cast as a <tt>JAWT_Win32DrawingSurfaceInfo*</tt> . And, of course,
the actual drawing operations would need to be changed to those
appropriate for the Microsoft Windows platform.
The same also for MacOS.
</p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>The ability to draw directly into a Java <tt>Canvas</tt> from a
native code library is extremely useful for developers planning to
migrate a legacy software system to Java, especially one that
includes a high-performance rendering engine. It makes it much
easier to migrate in stages, leaving performance-sensitive
rendering code alone, while other less-sensitive portions of code
are converted to Java. The result can be a modern Java-centric
application, providing the benefit of portability and development
efficiency, but one that does not sacrifice an investment in
performance of a key piece of native code.</p>

 * AWT native interface.
 *
 * The AWT native interface allows a native C or C++ application a means

 * legacy C and C++ applications to Java and to target the needs of the
 * developers who need to do their own native rendering to canvases
 * for performance or other reasons.
 *
 * Conversely it also provides mechanisms for an application which already
 * has a native window to provide that to AWT for AWT rendering.
 *
 * Since every platform may be different in its native data structures
 * and APIs for windowing systems the application must necessarily
 * provided per-platform source and compile and deliver per-platform
 * native code  to use this API.
 *
 * These interfaces are not part of the Java SE specification and
 * a VM is not required to implement this API. However it is strongly
 * recommended that all implementations which support headful AWT
 * also support these interfaces.
 *
 */

/*
 * AWT Native Drawing Surface (JAWT_DrawingSurface).
 *
 * For each platform, there is a native drawing surface structure.  This
 * platform-specific structure can be found in jawt_md.h.  It is recommended
 * that additional platforms follow the same model.  It is also recommended
 * that VMs on all platforms support the existing structures in jawt_md.h.

 *     jboolean result;
 *     jint lock;
 *
 *     // Get the AWT. Request version 9 to access features in that release.
 *     awt.version = JAWT_VERSION_9;
