<title>Collections Framework Overview</title>

<h1>Collections Framework Overview</h1>
<!-- Body text begins here -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Java platform includes a <i>collections framework</i>. A
<i>collection</i> is an object that represents a group of objects
(such as the classic <a href="../ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a> class).
A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing
and manipulating collections, enabling collections to be
manipulated independently of implementation details.
<p>The primary advantages of a collections framework are that
it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduces programming effort</strong> by providing data
structures and algorithms so you don't have to write them
yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Increases performance</strong> by providing
high-performance implementations of data structures and algorithms.
Because the various implementations of each interface are
interchangeable, programs can be tuned by switching
implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Provides interoperability between unrelated
APIs</strong> by establishing a common language to pass collections
back and forth.</li>
<li><strong>Reduces the effort required to learn APIs</strong> by
requiring you to learn multiple ad hoc collection APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Reduces the effort required to design and implement
APIs</strong> by not requiring you to produce ad hoc collections
APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Fosters software reuse</strong> by providing a standard
interface for collections and algorithms with which to manipulate
them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The collections framework consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection interfaces</strong>. Represent different
types of collections, such as sets, lists, and maps. These
interfaces form the basis of the framework.</li>
<li><strong>General-purpose implementations</strong>. Primary
implementations of the collection interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy implementations</strong>. The collection classes
from earlier releases, <tt>Vector</tt> and <tt>Hashtable</tt>, were
retrofitted to implement the collection interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Special-purpose implementations</strong>.
Implementations designed for use in special situations. These
implementations display nonstandard performance characteristics,
usage restrictions, or behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrent implementations</strong>. Implementations
designed for highly concurrent use.</li>
<li><strong>Wrapper implementations</strong>. Add functionality,
such as synchronization, to other implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Convenience implementations</strong>. High-performance
"mini-implementations" of the collection interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Abstract implementations</strong>. Partial
implementations of the collection interfaces to facilitate custom
implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Algorithms</strong>. Static methods that perform useful
functions on collections, such as sorting a list.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>. Interfaces that provide
essential support for the collection interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Array Utilities</strong>. Utility functions for arrays
of primitive types and reference objects. Not, strictly speaking, a
part of the collections framework, this feature was added to the
Java platform at the same time as the collections framework and
relies on some of the same infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Collection Interfaces</h2>
<p>The <i>collection interfaces</i> are divided into two groups.
The most basic interface, <tt><a href=
"../Collection.html">java.util.Collection</a></tt>,
has the following descendants:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt><a href=
"../Set.html">java.util.Set</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../SortedSet.html">java.util.SortedSet</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../NavigableSet.html">java.util.NavigableSet</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../Queue.html">java.util.Queue</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/BlockingQueue.html">java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/TransferQueue.html">java.util.concurrent.TransferQueue</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../Deque.html">java.util.Deque</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/BlockingDeque.html">java.util.concurrent.BlockingDeque</a></tt></li>
</ul>
<p>The other collection interfaces are based on <tt><a href=
"../Map.html">java.util.Map</a></tt> and are
not true collections. However, these interfaces contain
<i>collection-view</i> operations, which enable them to be
manipulated as collections. <tt>Map</tt> has the following
offspring:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt><a href=
"../SortedMap.html">java.util.SortedMap</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../NavigableMap.html">java.util.NavigableMap</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/ConcurrentMap.html">java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/ConcurrentNavigableMap.html">java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentNavigableMap</a></tt></li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the modification methods in the collection interfaces
are labeled <i>optional</i>. Implementations are permitted to not
perform one or more of these operations, throwing a runtime
exception (<tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>) if they are
attempted. The documentation for each implementation must specify
which optional operations are supported. Several terms are
introduced to aid in this specification:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collections that do not support modification operations (such
as <tt>add</tt>, <tt>remove</tt> and <tt>clear</tt>) are referred
to as <i>unmodifiable</i>. Collections that are not unmodifiable
are <i>modifiable.</i></li>
<li>Collections that additionally guarantee that no change in the
<tt>Collection</tt> object will be visible are referred to as
<i>immutable</i>. Collections that are not immutable are
<i>mutable</i>.</li>
<li>Lists that guarantee that their size remains constant even
though the elements can change are referred to as
<i>fixed-size</i>. Lists that are not fixed-size are referred to as
<i>variable-size</i>.</li>
<li>Lists that support fast (generally constant time) indexed
element access are known as <i>random access</i> lists. Lists that
do not support fast indexed element access are known as
<i>sequential access</i> lists. The <tt><a href=
"../RandomAccess.html">RandomAccess</a></tt>
marker interface enables lists to advertise the fact that they
support random access. This enables generic algorithms to change
their behavior to provide good performance when applied to either
random or sequential access lists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some implementations restrict what elements (or in the case of
<tt>Maps</tt>, keys and values) can be stored. Possible
restrictions include requiring elements to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be of a particular type.</li>
<li>Be not null.</li>
<li>Obey some arbitrary predicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attempting to add an element that violates an implementation's
restrictions results in a runtime exception, typically a
<tt>ClassCastException</tt>, an <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt>,
or a <tt>NullPointerException</tt>. Attempting to remove or test
for the presence of an element that violates an implementation's
restrictions can result in an exception. Some restricted
collections permit this usage.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Collection Implementations</h2>
<p>Classes that implement the collection interfaces typically have
names in the form of
&lt;<em>Implementation-style</em>&gt;&lt;<em>Interface</em>&gt;.
The general purpose implementations are summarized in the following
table:</p>
<table border="2" summary=
"general purpose implementations and interfaces" align="center">
<thead>
<tr>
<th id="interfaces">Interface</th>
<th id="hashtable">Hash Table</th>
<th id="resizablearray">Resizable Array</th>
<th id="balancedtree">Balanced Tree</th>
<th id="linkedlist">Linked List</th>
<th id="hashtableandlinkedlist">Hash Table + Linked List</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td headers="interfaces"><code>Set</code></td>
<td headers="hashtable"><a href=

</tr>

<td headers="resizablearray">&nbsp;</td>
<td headers="balancedtree"><a href=

<td headers="linkedlist">&nbsp;</td>
<td headers="hashtableandlinkedlist"><a href=
"../LinkedHashMap.html"><tt>LinkedHashMap</tt></a></td>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<p>The general-purpose implementations support all of the
<i>optional operations</i> in the collection interfaces and have no
restrictions on the elements they may contain. They are
unsynchronized, but the <tt>Collections</tt> class contains static
factories called <a href=
"../Collections.html#synchronizedCollection-java.util.Collection-">
<em>synchronization wrappers</em></a> that can be used to add
synchronization to many unsynchronized collections. All of the new
implementations have <i>fail-fast iterators</i>, which detect
invalid concurrent modification, and fail quickly and cleanly
(rather than behaving erratically).</p>
<p>The <tt>AbstractCollection</tt>, <tt>AbstractSet</tt>,
<tt>AbstractList</tt>, <tt>AbstractSequentialList</tt> and
<tt>AbstractMap</tt> classes provide basic implementations of the
core collection interfaces, to minimize the effort required to
implement them. The API documentation for these classes describes
precisely how each method is implemented so the implementer knows
which methods must be overridden, given the performance of the
basic operations of a specific implementation.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Concurrent Collections</h2>
<p>Applications that use collections from more than one thread must
be carefully programmed. In general, this is known as <i>concurrent
programming</i>. The Java platform includes extensive support for
concurrent programming. See <a href=
"../concurrent/package-summary.html">Java Concurrency
Utilities</a> for details.</p>
<p>Collections are so frequently used that various concurrent
friendly interfaces and implementations of collections are included
in the APIs. These types go beyond the synchronization wrappers
discussed previously to provide features that are frequently needed
in concurrent programming.</p>
<p>These concurrent-aware interfaces are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/BlockingQueue.html">BlockingQueue</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/TransferQueue.html">TransferQueue</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/BlockingDeque.html">BlockingDeque</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/ConcurrentMap.html">ConcurrentMap</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/ConcurrentNavigableMap.html">ConcurrentNavigableMap</a></tt></li>
</ul>
<p>The following concurrent-aware implementation classes are
available. See the API documentation for the correct usage of these
implementations.</p>
<ul>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/LinkedBlockingQueue.html">LinkedBlockingQueue</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/ArrayBlockingQueue.html">ArrayBlockingQueue</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/PriorityBlockingQueue.html">PriorityBlockingQueue</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/DelayQueue.html">DelayQueue</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/SynchronousQueue.html">SynchronousQueue</a></tt></li>
<li><a href=
"../concurrent/LinkedBlockingDeque.html"><tt>LinkedBlockingDeque</tt></a></li>
<li><a href=
"../concurrent/LinkedTransferQueue.html"><tt>LinkedTransferQueue</tt></a></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/CopyOnWriteArrayList.html">CopyOnWriteArrayList</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/CopyOnWriteArraySet.html">CopyOnWriteArraySet</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/ConcurrentSkipListSet.html">ConcurrentSkipListSet</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html">ConcurrentHashMap</a></tt></li>
<li><tt><a href=
"../concurrent/ConcurrentSkipListMap.html">ConcurrentSkipListMap</a></tt></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Design Goals</h2>
<p>The main design goal was to produce an API that was small in
size and, more importantly, in &quot;conceptual weight.&quot; It
was critical that the new functionality not seem too different to
current Java programmers; it had to augment current facilities,
rather than replace them. At the same time, the new API had to be
powerful enough to provide all the advantages described
previously.</p>
<p>To keep the number of core interfaces small, the interfaces do
not attempt to capture such subtle distinctions as mutability,
modifiability, and resizability. Instead, certain calls in the core
interfaces are <i>optional</i>, enabling implementations to throw
an <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> to indicate that they do
not support a specified optional operation. Collection implementers
must clearly document which optional operations are supported by an
implementation.</p>
<p>To keep the number of methods in each core interface small, an
interface contains a method only if either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a truly <i>fundamental operation</i>: a basic operations
in terms of which others could be reasonably defined,</li>
<li>There is a compelling performance reason why an important
implementation would want to override it.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was critical that all reasonable representations of
collections interoperate well. This included arrays, which cannot
be made to implement the <tt>Collection</tt> interface directly
without changing the language. Thus, the framework includes methods
to enable collections to be moved into arrays, arrays to be viewed
as collections, and maps to be viewed as collections.</p>
