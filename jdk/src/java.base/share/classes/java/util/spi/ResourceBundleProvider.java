/**
 * {@code ResourceBundleProvider} is a provider interface that is used for

 * this interface are loaded with {@link java.util.ServiceLoader ServiceLoader}
 * during a call to the
 * {@link ResourceBundle#getBundle(String, Locale, ClassLoader)
 * ResourceBundle.getBundle} method. The provider service type is determined by
 * {@code basename+"Provider"}.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, if the base name is "com.example.app.MyResources",
 * {@code com.example.app.MyResourcesProvider} will be the provider service type:
 * <pre>{@code
 * public interface MyResourcesProvider extends ResourceBundleProvider {
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This providers's {@link #getBundle(String, Locale) getBundle} method is called
 * through the resource bundle loading process instead of {@link
 * java.util.ResourceBundle.Control#newBundle(String, Locale, String, ClassLoader, boolean)
 * ResourceBundle.Control.newBundle()}. Refer to {@link ResourceBundle} for
 * details.
