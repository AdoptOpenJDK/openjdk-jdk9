 * @provides javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorProvider
 *           A provider of {@code JMXConnector} for the RMI protocol.<br>
 *           Instances of {@code JMXConnector} using the RMI protocol
 *           are usually created by the {@link
 *           javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorFactory} which will locate
 *           and load the appropriate {@code JMXConnectorProvider} service
 *           implementation for the given protocol.
